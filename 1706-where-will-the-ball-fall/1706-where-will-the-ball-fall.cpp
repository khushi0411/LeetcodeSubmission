/*Just think in a recursive way

#Forget about the final target
#Make smaller targets for each cell
#If ball is in any cell in the grid then we only have to solve a SUBPROBLEM

SUBPROBLEM=>
==========
#Smaller target for ball is to reach the next row
#We just want to somehow figure out solution to reach the next row for any current cell
#For any cell we have two scenarios
1. If board in currCell [grid[i][j]] is "RIGHT" :
=>We can move to next row if board in the rightCell of currCell [grid[i][j + 1]] is also "RIGHT"
2.If board in currCell [grid[i][j]] is "LEFT" :
=>We can move to next row if board in the leftCell of currCell [grid[i][j - 1]] is also "LEFT"

#If we cannot reach the next row after evaluating the above conditions
=>ANSWER TO SUBPROBLEM ==> -1 :(

#If ball is able to get into the next row
=>Now we are closer to out goal to reach bottom row
=>We are in some cell of nextRow depending on above scenarios
=>Now it's again a same "SUBPROBLEM" [RECURSION AT IT'S BEST :)] but with reduced size
=>ANSWER TO CURRENT SUBPROBLEM => Answer of next subproblem (for a grid cell of next row)
#Answer to any subproblem will be the column by which it get's into the next row

#If you can't find a solution to the bigger problem
#Just figure out what all you can do at current steps
#The next step will be ultimately solved using "RECURSION" :) [LIFE PHILOSOPHY]
